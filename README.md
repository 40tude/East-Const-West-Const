Bonjour,

this is a simple set of tests showing how **const** qualifier can be used : on the right side or on the left side of the type? 

Since a decision must be made, and no matter what the traditions may say, I will put **const** on the right side (east side) of the type and I will do my best to remain consistent.

The main reason is that, when a **const** appear on the line, then reading the code from left to right help me a lot to better understand the intent. This may not be the case for you.

Anyway, take a few minutes to read the code and take your own decision.
I say read because as you will see I wrote some comments in order to really explain how I read the code. 

Again, I do not want to convince you to put **const** on the left or the right. 
I just want to make sure you understand you do so.

Regards, Philippe 


PS : For what I understand, so far (March 2018) the best way to name your gist the way you want is to include an md file with 2 leading dot (..east_const_west_const.md in my case). Otherwise the name of the gist is based on the alphabetical order of the files and the name of the gist may change as soon as you add a file named AAA_My_New_File.cpp.
